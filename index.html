                    The band members were involved in a host of musical projects together
                    before
                    the formation of Parcels, playing music together in and out of different bands since they were 13
                    years old. They played in different groups experimenting with genres of funk, folk, metal and
                    bluegrass. Serret and Crommelin were the only two members of Parcels who had not previously played
                    music together.</p>
